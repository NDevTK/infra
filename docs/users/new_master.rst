Setting Up a New Master
=======================

To set up a new master, you need three ports. File an `Infra-Labs ticket`_
requesting ports for a new master and ask which VLAN your master
should be on (and hence which master_base_class you should use).

The port numbers and master_base_class settings go into your ``builders.pyl``
config file (see below).

Then create a new master directory in ``build/masters`` or
``build_internal/masters`` depending on whether this is a Google internal
master.::

  $ cd $BUILD_DIR/masters
  $ mkdir master.foo.bar
  $ cd master.foo.bar

Create a ``builders.pyl`` file describing the builders on this master.  The
format is documented in :doc:`the builders.pyl file format <builders_pyl>`_.
Set the port numbers and master_base_class to the values you got from Labs,
above.

You will also need slaves allocated for all your builders. File
an `Infra-Labs ticket`_ for those also, and specify how many of each
configuration you will need. They will be configured in this file.::

  $ cp $BUILD_DIR/masters/master.chromium.mojo/builders.pyl .
  <edit builders.pyl to taste>

After this file exists, you can use ``buildbot-tool`` to generate the rest of
the master configuration.::

  $ $BUILD_DIR/scripts/tools/buildbot-tool gen `pwd`

You'll also need to add your new master to the long list in
``$BUILD_DIR/tests/masters_test.py``.::

  # Add this line to $BUILD_DIR/tests/masters_test.py next to the other lines
  # that look like this.
  'master.foo.bar': 'FooBar',

You can find the class name ``FooBar`` in the ``master_site_config.py`` that
was generated in your master directory.

Commit what you have, then file a third, final `Infra-Labs ticket`_ asking for
the appropriate URLs to be set up for your master.
