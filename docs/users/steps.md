# Infra steps in the builds

This page describes the purpose of various common steps in builders on
the waterfall and tryservers.

## find_isolated_tests step

Returns a list of *.isolated files together with their SHA1 hashes. Such hash
identifies the isolated file tree. It's passed from builder to a tester, or to a
swarming job where it is used to reconstruct the file tree (by downloading files
from the isolate server). *.isolated files are built during compilation (ninja
invokes isolate.py)

# clean_isolated_files step

Removes .isolate files from the build directory before compilation (and
isolation), to ensure no stale *.isolated are left.

# cleanup_temp step

This step is a hack, which tries to delete portions of the live temp directory
based on a variety of hard-coded globs. This is not scalable as people change
file names and do not update globs and won't work on Windows, since processes
with handles to files make them un-deletable, so there is no way to have this
step *fail*, since there's no way to know if it *should* be able to delete a
given file.
