# Documenting

Documentation in infra.git should cover these subjects:

* Introductory material, to help newcomers use and contribute to the
  codebase.
* Links to design documents, explaining decisions and overall structure. The
  point of these docs is to give a high-level view of the organisation
  and inner working.

## How to edit these docs

These docs are in
[Markdown](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gitiles/+/master/Documentation/markdown.md)
and rendered by Gitiles on the fly. To see the source of a file, click "source"
link below any rendered page.

In-depth articles documents are stored in [docs](.) directory. When creating
a new page, remember to add a link to it in the [developers.md](developers.md)
or [users/index.md](users/index.md) file.
