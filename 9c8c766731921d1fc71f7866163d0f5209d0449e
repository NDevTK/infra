I want to do that but VSINSTALLDIR is set in recipe step (https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/main:recipes/recipe_modules/windows_sdk/api.py;l\u003d114?q\u003dVSINSTALLDIR\u0026sq\u003d\u0026ss\u003dchromium) and not available locally. Although we only upload wheels from try-job, the wheel build failure on local environment may be confusing. I haven\u0027t found a clean solution for the problem, do you have any idea?",
