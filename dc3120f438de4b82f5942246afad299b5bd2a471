      "message": "I\u0027m actually unsure about the value of removing window.location references to be honest - although it sort of looks ugly, page.js is still using window/window.location under the hood as well. ie: https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js/blob/4f9991658f9b9e3de9b6059bade93693af24d6bd/page.js#L465 \n\nIt is ultimately the API that the browser provides for finding the current URL of a page and attempts to try to avoid using this seem like they would lead to making code more complex with limited benefit. \n\nNeither of the two major JS style guides I tend to reference, The Google style guide ( https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html ) and the AirBnB style guide ( https://github.com/airbnb/javascript ), seem to recommend removing as many window references as possible, which makes me think it\u0027s not really a problem, but I could be convinced otherwise if this is a documented best practice elsewhere.",
