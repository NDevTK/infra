      "message": "I think my wording is a bit unclear in the question. I understand that allowing the interface to be changeable from the command lets us change the used interface from the yaml file as against creating and deploying a new init container image.\n\nIIUC, the cluster admins will still have some restrictions like - all nodes in a cluster must have the same interface enabled on all nodes in a cluster.\n\nIn case of 2 clusters within the same lab (for eg, HTL has two clusters ATM), should all nodes in the two clusters have the same interface enabled? If not, then will we need 2 separate yaml files to accommodate the differences in interfaces?",
