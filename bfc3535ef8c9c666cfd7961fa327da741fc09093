      "message": "missing a `casClients[instance] \u003d client` statement somewhere?\n\nBacking up a bit: Are there going to be lots of these clients per cli invocation, and are they noticeably expensive to construct?  If they\u0027re actually worth caching, you might want to use a proper cache (with evictions etc) instead of a map that just grows and grows.  Otherwise, wdyt about simplifying this code and just creating a new client every time?",
