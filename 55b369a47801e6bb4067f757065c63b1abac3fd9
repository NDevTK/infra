      "message": "I made the assumption previously that the output for a run command would contain both STDOUT and STDERR but it only contains STDOUT, which means we were never getting any error messages. As far as I can tell, there\u0027s no way to get the STDERR from a run command: This seems like an oversight? And or room for improvement? STDERR gets printed to the console, but isn\u0027t obtainable otherwise. @otabek@chromium.org",
