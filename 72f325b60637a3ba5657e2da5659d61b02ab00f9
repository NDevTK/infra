By which I mean, I have no idea what \u0027FVS\u0027 means and it doesn\u0027t help me understand the code.\n\nCode search reveals: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/infra/appengine/monorail/api/converters.py?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dmonorail+fvs\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d210 which makes me think this is \"Field Values\"\n\n\n_fieldVals or _fieldValues would be clearer. Though the same could be said for fid, etc. Perhaps I should just be more familiar with the protos such that I\u0027d get it. A little bit of code searching did get me there.",
