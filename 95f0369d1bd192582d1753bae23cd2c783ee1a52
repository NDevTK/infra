      "message": "This is going to be confusing to users who see results near 100K.  The reason is that the results are really capped at 10K per shard.  It is possible that one shard will hit its cap while other shards do not.  So, a result that would ideally have, say 90,000 issues could show up as 88,000 if 12,000 of those were in one shard.  A better approach would be for QueryIssueSnapshots() to check if any shard reached 10,000, and if so, return true for a third return value limit_reached.  This is similar to the search_limit_reached dict in frontendsearchpipeline.py.  If the limit is reached in any shard, then display a message saying that \"Some results are not being counted, please narrow your query for accurate counts\" or something like that.",
