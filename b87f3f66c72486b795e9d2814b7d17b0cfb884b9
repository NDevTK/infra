      "message": "I don\u0027t feel keep CL small should main driving factor here, sometimes breakdown one \"functionality\" into different CLs causing hard to review to catch context, also there is risk that we forget some implementation later. Also in this particular case, say we include every filter in here the CL size is still relatively small.",

      "message": "The `board` field is one of the simplest. I can also add `model` and `sku`, but `location` for example will need more complicated logic because the location fields are less convenient to type and I will need some abbreviations.\n\nThe `board` is the most straightforward filter, so I want us to agree on this one first, and then I\u0027ll implement the other ones using it as a template.",
