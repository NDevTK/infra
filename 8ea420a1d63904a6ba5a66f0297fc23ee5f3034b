      "message": "Ah, you\u0027re right. I think I inverted the condition at some point and incorrectly just flipped the inequality. In practice I don\u0027t think it makes a difference, since the completely disjoint case isn\u0027t possible (that would require pip download to fetch a version that didn\u0027t match the parameters we gave it). But for clarity I\u0027ve made the suggested change.",
