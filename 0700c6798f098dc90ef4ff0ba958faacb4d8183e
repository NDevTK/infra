      "message": "Otabek, this CL has two actions that together verify CCD power delivery (as discussed yesterday).\n\nHowever, the original plan included extra-args to exclude models puff (it also includes \"hh\" as excluded model, but that looks like a typing mistake).\n\nThis can be done by adding an exec in dut_execs.go that checks whether the value of a DUT property (such as Model) matches an expected value. Then a condition can be created about his.\n\nPlease let me know if this models should be handled for this CCD Power Delivery verifier, and will complete that within this CL. \n",
