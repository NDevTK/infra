I think host makes more sence in that case as that is not related the type of the device, where that is about host(type of host) with RPM data. \n\nExample: Cros is ChromeOS device and it can be a DUT and servo-host, and also WIfiRouter. where all of them are different hosts dut, servo-host, wifi_router, chameleon",
