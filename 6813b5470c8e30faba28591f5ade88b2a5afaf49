This also automatically leads to basepath.\n * similarly, map can determine which analyzers to run.\nDid I miss anything?\n\nFinally, both patch_root and analyzers list can be provided via proto config for the recipe and thus hardcoded inside our starlark config (infra/config). This is better than map in a recipe, as it makes recipe generic. For our use-case, it\u0027s probably not giving a huge advantage. However, it\u0027s useful for those, who use our recipe as an inspiration (read: copy-pasta or forking).",
