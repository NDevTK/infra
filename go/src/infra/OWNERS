# go.mod and go.sum have tricky interaction with DEPS (due to "replace"
# directives). When the gclient checkout is inconsistent, "go build" will modify
# or suggest *wrong* changes to go.mod/go.sum.
#
# Require review from folks that support Go infra build environment to avoid
# mistakenly landing bad go.mod/go.sum.
#
# Generally you'll need it *only* when adding new dependencies or updating
# existing ones or when landing DEPS rolls. If you just modify *.go code in
# the infra repository, and "go build" insists on changing go.mod or asks you to
# run "go get", then most likely you have inconsistent gclient checkout and need
# to run "gclient sync" or equivalent to update it.
