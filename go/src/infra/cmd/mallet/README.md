# Mallet command line tool

This is a tool for running ad hoc maintenance tasks
that bypasses the ordinary infrastructure.

## Requirements

You should have Go installed. Refer to [Go env setup](go/fleet-creating-work-env) to set up your
environment.

## Make and build

Run the following commands:
```
make mallet
```

## Login

```
go run main.go login
```

## Running auto-repair with Mallet

There are a few ways how you can run auto-repair with local changes.
1) changes in configurations or plans: can be tested by scheduling them with custom config. For more details go/fleet-recovery-developer#local-tests-with-custom-config
2) changes in execs - requires run from workstation only. More details go/fleet-recovery-developer#local-tests

## Example use of mallet: Running auto-repair from local code

To run auto-repair locally use `local-recovery` task. Due to access to the devices requiring special access please configure ssh configs (go/chromeos-lab-duts-ssh) and then create proxies by [labtunel](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/dev-util/+/HEAD/contrib/labtunnel/README.md). Then you need to run the below command with the replacement:
- `HOST_PROXIES_JSON`: created proxies by labtunel(eg."{\"dut-1\":\"127.0.0.1:2200\",\"dut-2\":\"127.0.0.1:2201\",}").
- `DUT_NAME`: name of the DUT known in UFS.

```
go run main.go local -host-proxies HOST_PROXIES_JSON {DUT_NAME}
```

## Scheduling a job with Mallet

Command `recovery` is designed to schedule custom builder tasks and be able to accept custom config if provided.
