// OwnershipRecorder is the interface to manage ownership state in the server.
// If an entity (container/network) is started/created by the server, the server
// "owns" the entity and is responsible to recycle (stop/remove) at server exit.
// An ownership is identified by the entity name (supplied by client) and the ID
// (generated by docker). Ownership with the same name can be redeclared to a
// different ID; the old ID will be abandoned permanently.
// Redeclaration may happen due to local development, client bugs, and/or
// unexpected stop of containers. As long as an action is accepted by the
// underlying docker commands, the server follows suit and records the state.
