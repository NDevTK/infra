# ChromeOS Try

This package implements the `cros try` CLI, a successor to the old `cros
tryjob` CLI. It enables users to run ad-hoc ChromeOS builders with common
custom configurations.

This tool is currently under active development. You can find the design doc at:
go/tryjobs-2

We created a stabilize branch, "stabilize-15185.B" for testing. Feel free to
run production tryjobs on this branch.

## Deployment

For instruction on how to deploy try, see
