# SuiteManager

This project implements the commands necessary for SuiteManager to function.
go/suitemanager-dd for more information.

# Status: WIP
The UI is well underway but this CLI is in the initial stages. Work to come will
include Firestore auto-replication of the suite_scheduler.ini file, .ini
replication of SuiteManager changes, and command line tools to modify SuSch
configs.
