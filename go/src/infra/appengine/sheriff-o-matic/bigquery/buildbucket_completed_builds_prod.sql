  -- This materialized view is not created by create_views.sh because:
  --   - Updating or replacing materialized views is not supported (they must be deleted and then recreated)
  --   - Deleting and recreating materialized views can be expensive as it re-queries the entire history of the underlying table
  --   - A single materialized view is used for both staging and production
  --
  -- Thus, if this needs to be updated, please do it manually through pantheon.
  --
  -- Note that materialized views do not support a lot of SQL features, so we are limited in what we can do here.
  -- The main goal is to cut down the amount of data required to be queried by pre-filtering and clustering (BigQuery pre-sorting) data.
