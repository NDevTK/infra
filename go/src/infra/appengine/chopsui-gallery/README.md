# chopsui-gallery

chopsui-gallery.appspot.com, an app containing documentation
and demos for polymer elements in the chops-ui package

## Prerequisites

Download and install the [AppEngine SDK for Go](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/go/download).

You will need a chrome infra checkout as
[described here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/). That will
create a local checkout of the entire infra repo, but that will include this
application and many of its dependencies.

You'll also need some extras that aren't in the default infra checkout.

```sh
# sudo where appropriate for your setup.

npm install -g bower
```

make sure you've
run
```
eval `../../../../env.py`
```
in that shell window.

## Running the app locally

```sh
make build
gae.py devserver -A chopsui-gallery
```

## Updating the app

When the chops-ui package releases a new version, the chopsui-gallery should be updated.

To have chopsui-gallery reflect the changes made in the chops-ui package run the following commands:

```sh
make build
gae.py upload -A chopsui-gallery
gae.py switch # to allocate all traffic to the new version.
```

'make build' creates several new directories,
whenever necessary run:

```sh
make clean
```

to remove those files before doing 'make build' again.
