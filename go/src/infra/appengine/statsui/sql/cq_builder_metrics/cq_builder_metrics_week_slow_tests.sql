-- This query updates the 'P50 Slow Tests' and 'P90 Slow Tests' metrics in the cq_builder_metrics_week
-- table. It uses an interval of the last 8 days so that on Mondays, it will update stats for the full
-- previous week as well as stats for the current week.
-- Slow tests are defined as tests that take longer than 5 minutes to run at P50, or 10m to run at P90.
-- We also exclude any tests that have fewer than 50 runs to remove one-off test runs like
-- https://crrev.com/c/2545074/13
-- This query is meant to be almost identical to the one in cq_builder_metrics_day_slow_tests.sql.

-- The lines below are used by the deploy tool.
--name: Populate cq_builder_metrics_week slow test metrics
