## vpython2.7

This directory contains a forked copy of vpython which is known to work with
Python 2.7, and has this interpreter bundled.

It is intended for specific, limited use cases where migrating to Python 3
is not feasible.

Please do not add dependencies on vpython2.7 without talking to vpython
OWNERS first to discuss your use case.

See [https://source.chromium.org/chromium/infra/infra/+/main:go/src/go.chromium.org/luci/vpython/] for current vpython code and documentation.
