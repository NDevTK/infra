      "message": "I am wondering if there is a way to break out OpenSSH into two package results from one package definition.\n\nUnlike OpenSSL, OpenSSH does not \"install\" libs and header files. OpenSSH only installs the binary executables. So is it possible to upload a tools package with the normal install bits and a static_libs package with just the libs and headers?\n\nOr should it be broken out into two separate 3pp packages?",

      "message": "Yeah. I want to switch back to doing git clones. This should be easy for hiba source. So I\u0027ll change that one now. Any specific suggestions about matching up `V_9_7_P1` and `9.7p1` are welcome. I was considering:\n\n```\ntag_pattern: \"V_%s\"\nversion_join: \"_\"\n```\n\nbut that would not quite match.\n\n`9.7p1` would be `V_9_7p1`\nor\n`V_9_7_P1` would be `9.7.p1`\n\n\nSeparately, I noticed that UrlSource does not seem to have an option to specify a file signature (e.g. sha256 sum) to ensure the archive is what you expect and not tampered with. Is there a reason to not do that or should it be added?",
