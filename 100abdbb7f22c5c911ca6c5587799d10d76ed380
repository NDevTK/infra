      "message": "Since this file is manually generated:\ndon\u0027t use tabs for alignment! Use tabs for semantic indentation. But using tabs (which your editor apparently makes equivalent to two spaces) for alignment is terrible. The \"jobsReference\" should be aligned with \"totalRows\" *no matter what the tab width is*. That is not true in this file if the tab width is set to anything other than 2 spaces. Please fix this file, and then you\u0027ll also have an easier time reviewing it.",
