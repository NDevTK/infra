      "message": "Checking back against the pastebin: these are the differences I see.\n\n1. config rather than project_id: I wanted project_id checking to happen first thing in ingestion, given that it is the \u0027parent\u0027\n2. Returning the tuple with the enums instead of just the FieldValues\n  - I wanted to be able to still use ShiftEnumFieldsIntoLabels, per the comment in my CL description around maximizing reuse.\n\nI would also not accept this method signature for a public method, but for private methods I\u0027m fine with messier signatures.\n\nPlease follow up in an email for if you want discussion so I can make sure I see it.",
