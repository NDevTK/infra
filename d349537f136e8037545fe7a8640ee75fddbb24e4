      "message": "without insert ids, what\u0027s the value BigQueryHelper provides besides locking? If the user of the library doesn\u0027t have many threads, BigQueryHelper does not help. If there is a lot of threads sending events, send_rows will block all those threads because of the globalish lock. I guess that\u0027s why CQ has AsyncPush that sends events using BigQueryHelper in a separate thread and does benefit from the locking. Looks like CQ is the only user of BQH and nobody takes advantage of the only feature that BQH provides.\n\nmessage_to_row (or row_from_message) would be a very valuable feature of this package.",
