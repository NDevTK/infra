      "message": "It can be on the \u003ctable\u003e instead. Originally, I did it this way because I tried to find a way to make aria attributes work across shadow DOM. ie: I tested having the input reference the id of a shadowRoot which would then references its children elements. That approach didn\u0027t end up working at all, but I ended up keeping the aria attributes on the main element since it works either way.",
