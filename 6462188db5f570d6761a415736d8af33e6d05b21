Project is required (b/c at least the project repo will be in the local_manifest.xml in the project), program and chipset are optional: http://cs/chromeos_public/src/config/setup_project.sh?l\u003d133\u0026rcl\u003de1fa0d7f56eb3dd6e9378e4326de086ada46b7d3.\n\nThis is b/c all projects are expected to have local manifests, only some programs have local_manifests (https://source.corp.google.com/search?q\u003df:local_manifest.xml%20f:program\u0026sq\u003dpackage:(chromeos_public%7Cchromeos_internal)).
