It is odd the token is still generated by the python code.\n\nIf you want to extract build_id from the token *exclusively* from the backend code, this approach is fine. But extracting it from client-side code (like bbagent) will be less ideal, since I don\u0027t want the token format to be part of the public API of the service. It is not a good format (it was invented long time ago before I knew better).",
