      "message": "FYI, it looks like some tests outside of your change failed following the changes in this CL - All of the failing tests are tests that use the enterInput function, which makes use of @testing-library/user-event: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/infra/infra/+/main:appengine/monorail/static_src/shared/test/helpers.js;l\u003d50 \n\nI believe the root cause is the dependency change to @testing-library/user-event from https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/infra/infra/+/3054399/7/appengine/monorail/package.json#18 \n\nIn the past, we were using @testing-library/user-event@^13.2.0, but this change lowered the version to @testing-library/user-event@^12.0.0-alpha.3\n\nI believe the accidental inclusion of a `describe.only()` masked this problem in the previous CL. \n\nTo fix this CL and allow it to make it through presubmit, we will want to bump our @testing-library/user-event version back to ^13.2.0.",

The best thing to do would probably be to try to get your tests to work with the newer version because: \n\n* There\u0027s more code using that newer version than the older version. \n* We generally want to lean towards newer versions of things rather than older versions if we can.",
