What\u0027s the justification for 2?\n\nI\u0027ve seen people stress over a 10 minute _delay_ in changes to build_limited, and from that perspective 2 hours might seem high.\n\nFor now I\u0027m fine with any value, especially if anyone has strong opinions. Ideally we\u0027d record some metrics for the delay and pick threshold based on actual data. Specific suggestions how to accomplish that would be welcome.",
