      "message": "similar to other comment- wondering if we can just pass an `executor` to ReadContents?\n\nOr, alternatively, it seems like many functions let a dev pass in a specific `ReadContents` function- wondering if we just use that pattern for testing (ex. `DeleteRecords` takes in a `recordEnsurer` function- could we just pass in a testing version of the function if we need to test it?\n\neither way- using these structs in a test in the same CL where they are added helps understand why we are refactoring like this",
