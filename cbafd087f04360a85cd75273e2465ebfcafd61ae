      "message": "Agree with Derek\u0027s question here, it\u0027s still not clear why GCE image import takes longer occasionally. Side note, found an old dashboard I created for VM image and instance creation metrics: https://dashboards.corp.google.com/edit/_7e5e7d44_df5a_4a89_ba4a_5e4cb2f7c62a. It kinda aligns with Varun\u0027s findings, the max value is close to 20 minutes and the average being close to 4 minutes. I believe 3-4 minute was expected but 20 minutes is too long. Can we create a separate bug to investigate this further?",
