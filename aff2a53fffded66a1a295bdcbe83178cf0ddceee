Having an except clause for AssertionError means that you could be catching failed asserts in some function that is called.  An if-statement would be a better choice here.  You could even have something like:\nif framework_constants.MONORAIL_SCOPE not in authorized_scopes:\n  raise oauth.Error(\u0027Work around for b/144508063\u0027)",
