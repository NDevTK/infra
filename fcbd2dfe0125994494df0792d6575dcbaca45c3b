I am tempted, but I also wanted to make these testable in a sensible way.\n\nOne option would be to have subpackages:\n- .../vpython/pep425/mac\n- .../vpython/pep425/linux\n\nThen have the \"pep425\" test code import mac/linux/etc. and test against them. This would be fine, but seemed like overkill to avoid compiling a few extra bytes of logic into the main code base, so I went with this.",
