# TODO(http://crbug.com/659346): since most of our unit tests are
# FinditForFracas-specific, wrengr moved them to findit_for_chromecrash_test.py.
# However, now we're missing coverage for most of this file (due to the
# buggy way coverage is computed). Need to add a bunch of new unittests
# to get coverage back up.

# TODO: this class depends on ndb stuff, and should therefore move to
# cr-culprit-finder/service/predator as part of the big reorganization.
# This class should be renamed to avoid confustion between Findit and Predator.
# Think of a good name (e.g.'PredatorApp') for this class.
