# Buildbucket

Buildbucket is a generic build queue. A build requester can schedule a build
and wait for a result. A building system, such as Swarming, can lease it, build
it and report a result back.

## Rewrite

Currently Buildbucket is in the middle of a service rewrite in Go. The new code
is found under [luci-go](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/refs/heads/main/buildbucket/appengine/)
and is intended to support an in-place migration from the Python service located
here.

* Umbrella bug: [g-issues.chromium.org/issues/40115072](https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues/40115072).
* Project review record:
  [crbug.com/chrome-operations/26](https://crbug.com/chrome-operations/26).

### Deployment

The [service configuration](./app.yaml) for Buildbucket is located in this
directory, but the [cron
job](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/refs/heads/main/buildbucket/appengine/frontend/cron.yaml)
and [task queue](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/refs/heads/main/buildbucket/appengine/frontend/queue.yaml)
configs are found in luci-go. All Python and Go GAE services must be uploaded
for Buildbucket to function. [dispatch.yaml](./dispatch.yaml) defines which HTTP
routes are served by the Go AppEngine service (known as `default-go`).

Deployment of `cr-buildbucket` requires
[gae.py](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-py/+/refs/heads/main/appengine/components/tools/gae.py)
similar to other LUCI services whose deployment has not yet been automated. The
Buildbucket Python services (`default`, `backend`) are deployed from
this directory. To deploy the Go service (`default-go`), see the dummy
[app.yaml](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/refs/heads/main/buildbucket/appengine/frontend/app.yaml)
file for instructions. Note that `cr-buildbucket-dev` has its Python services
[automatically deployed](https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/infradata/gae/+/refs/heads/main/apps/cr-buildbucket/).

* In this dir: `gae.py upload -A cr-buildbucket{,-dev}`
* In
  [luci-go](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/refs/heads/main/buildbucket/appengine/frontend/):
  `gae.py upload -A cr-buildbucket{,-dev} default-go`
