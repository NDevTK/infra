  Build key:
    Build keys are autogenerated, monotonically decreasing integers.
    That is, when sorted by key, new builds are first.
    Build has no parent.

    Build id is a 64 bits integer represented as a string to the user.
    - 1 highest order bit is set to 0 to keep value positive.
    - 43 bits are 43 lower bits of bitwise-inverted time since
      BEGINING_OF_THE_WORLD at 1ms resolution.
      It is good for 2**43 / 365.3 / 24 / 60 / 60 / 1000 = 278 years
      or 2010 + 278 = year 2288.
    - 16 bits are set to a random value. Assuming an instance is internally
      consistent with itself, it can ensure to not reuse the same 16 bits in two
      consecutive requests and/or throttle itself to one request per
      millisecond. Using random value reduces to 2**-15 the probability of
      collision on exact same timestamp at 1ms resolution, so a maximum
      theoretical rate of 65536000 requests/sec but an effective rate in the
      range of ~64k qps without much transaction conflicts. We should be fine.
    - 4 bits are 0. This is to represent the 'version' of the entity
      schema.

    The idea is taken from Swarming TaskRequest entity:
    https://code.google.com/p/swarming/source/browse/appengine/swarming/server/task_request.py#329

  Attributes:
    status (BuildStatus): status of the build.
    bucket (string): a generic way to distinguish builds. Different buckets have
      different permissions.
    tags (list of string): a list of tags, where each tag is a string with ":"
      symbol. The first occurance of ":" splits tag name and tag value.
    parameters (dict): immutable arbitrary build parameters.
    pubsub_callback (PubSubCallback): PubSub message parameters for build status
      change notifications.
    lease_expiration_date (datetime): current lease expiration date.
      The moment the build is leased, |lease_expiration_date| is set to
      (utcnow + lease_duration).
    lease_key (int): None if build is not leased, otherwise a random value.
      Changes every time a build is leased. Can be used to verify that a client
      is the leaseholder.
    is_leased (bool): True if the build is currently leased. Otherwise False
    never_leased (bool): True if the build was never leased before.
    url (str): a URL to a build-system-specific build, viewable by a human.
    result (BuildResult): build result.
    cancelation_reason (CancelationReason): why the build was canceled.
