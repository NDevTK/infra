  Build key:
    Build keys are autogenerated, monotonically decreasing integers.
    That is, when sorted by key, new builds are first.
    Build has no parent.

    Build id is a 64 bits integer represented as a string to the user.
    - 1 highest order bit is set to 0 to keep value positive.
    - 43 bits are 43 lower bits of bitwise-inverted time since
      BEGINING_OF_THE_WORLD at 1ms resolution.
      It is good for 2**43 / 365.3 / 24 / 60 / 60 / 1000 = 278 years
      or 2010 + 278 = year 2288.
    - 16 bits are set to a random value. Assuming an instance is internally
      consistent with itself, it can ensure to not reuse the same 16 bits in two
      consecutive requests and/or throttle itself to one request per
      millisecond. Using random value reduces to 2**-15 the probability of
      collision on exact same timestamp at 1ms resolution, so a maximum
      theoretical rate of 65536000 requests/sec but an effective rate in the
      range of ~64k qps without much transaction conflicts. We should be fine.
    - 4 bits are 0. This is to represent the 'version' of the entity
      schema.
