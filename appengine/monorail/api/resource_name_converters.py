"""Methods for converting resource names to protorpc objects and back.

IngestFoo methods take resource names and return the IDs of the resources.
While some Ingest methods need to check for the existence of resources as
a side-effect of producing their IDs, other layers that call these methods
should always do their own validity checking.

ConvertFoo methods take object ids
(and sometimes a MonorailConnection and ServiceManager)
and return resource names.
