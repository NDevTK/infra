"""A simple profiler object to track how time is spent on a request.

The profiler is called from application code at the begining and
end of each major phase and subphase of processing.  The profiler
object keeps track of how much time was spent on each phase or subphase.

This class is useful when developers need to understand where
server-side time is being spent.  It includes durations in
milliseconds, and a simple bar chart on the HTML page.

On-page debugging and performance info is useful because it makes it easier
to explore performance interactively.
