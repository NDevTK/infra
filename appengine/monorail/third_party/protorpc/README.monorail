Description:
Local Modifications:
1. Retain only the protorpc/remote.py file.
2. Rename my_service.async to my_service.async_
   We don't use the async feature, and it's a reserved keyword in Python 3.
3. Check for the existence of array.array.tostring(), and use
   array.array.tobytes() as an alternative. It's been renamed in Python 3.
