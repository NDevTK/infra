      "message": "The solution to the \"long line\" problem in Go is to lean on local variables: you don\u0027t need complicated indentation/line-length rules if you don\u0027t have long lines in the first place ;)\n\nIt\u0027s in part a judgement call, though, based on how complex the line is. I almost inlined the Format call into the Println call, and if it were simpler (e.g. if I didn\u0027t need the MarshalOptions thing) I likely would have just inlined it.\n\nSo feel free if I\u0027m ever writing some code that you think should be broken out differently, I\u0027m happy to compromise when relevant.",
