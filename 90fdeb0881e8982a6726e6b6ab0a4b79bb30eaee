      "message": "sorry sorry, i meant to do this but forgot as I marked this ready for review.\n\nAdded a TODO, but also\n\nRemoveIssuesFromHotlists is called by v0 API hotlist management paths. \nIt manages removing issues from several hotlists at once \nand calls a different features_svc method that we eventually also want to remove. https://source.chromium.org/chromium/infra/infra/+/master:appengine/monorail/services/features_svc.py;l\u003d917?q\u003dfeatures_svc\u0026ss\u003dchromium%2Finfra%2Finfra:appengine%2Fmonorail%2F\n\nWe\u0027re not sure if we want to support adding to several hotlists at once in v3 or how we would want to do this and I don\u0027t want to merge the v3 and v0 paths right now because I think that would make deleting v0 paths more complicated later and possibly result in a messier final v3 path implementation.\nThis method is needed currently to support Dave\u0027s work to remove issues from a hotlist.",
