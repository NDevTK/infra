The when Findit analyzes b1Î©, it\u0027ll see that  t3\u0027s first_failed_build is b10, and last_pass is b1. \n\nI don\u0027t remember the detailed logic, but just want to make sure it\u0027ll not be a problem.",

      "message": "Yup, I also noticed this subtle change of behavior when fixing the broken tests in the file analysis_api_test (changing self.build_info -\u003e  build_121_info).\n\nI think this is OK because there is no guarantee that the compile target [t1,t2] actually succeeded in b2~b9, what we know is just that there is no information of [t1, t2] in b2-\u003eb9. For example, in https://docs.google.com/document/d/12p-JSWOtRV1-8liHYweZf8buJoQpvbl3gnfyZXAMP5o, Case 1, although some compile target failures were not found in a build, they actually did happen in previous builds. So I think in this case, it is safer to take the range from b1-\u003eb10.",
