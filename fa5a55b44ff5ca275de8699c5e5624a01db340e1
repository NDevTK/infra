      "message": "I think the API should be more low level, e.g. AddDutsToDrone, RemoveDutsFromDrone, ListDrones\n\nThis API would be used for moving duts around, draining drones, etc. as well (ideally we would reach a point where we have a service that regularly drains drones and reimages them and migrates DUTs back to ensure the system is robust).\n\nChoosing which drone to add a DUT back to can be determined by the client, e.g. by calling ListDrones.\n\n1. The user calls skylab activate-dut foo.\n2. skylab calls ListDrones API followed by AddDutsToDrone.\n\nSo the end user UI is simple, but the API is flexible for other use cases.",

      "message": "Sure, as long as it is not difficult to explicitly add and remove DUTs to a specific drone.\n\nI\u0027d prefer not putting any drone assignment logic in the admin service, but I can see a case for putting some basic logic in here for convenience.  The key point is that it be possible to implement more complex assignment logic externally, since a drone reprovisioning service should be implementable as a separate service rather than jamming all of that domain specific logic into the admin service.",
