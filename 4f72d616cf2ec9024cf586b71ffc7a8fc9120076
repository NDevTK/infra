      "message": "PTAL, the \"display_mode\" parameter is no longer used now that the new issue list and grid pages use the exact same ListIssues API (which in turn have no mode option). \n\nNotes: \n\n- Hotlists seem to have their own implementation of grid mode, separate from FrontendSearchPipeline, so that code is unaffected.\n- Endpoints API also allows specifying a mode, but it\u0027s unclear why a user would want to do this in an API call.
