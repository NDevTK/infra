      "message": "Hmm organizationally it appears these are test type specific operations that eventually depend on GetNearestComponentForPath, which I think really should be the only function here. How about move these outside to separate modules (either existing or new ones)? It seems they\u0027re doing test-type-specific preprocessing whereas issue_tracking_service should be the actual layer that handles talking to monorail.\n\ne.g. GetComponent and GetGtestComponent can be moved to a different appropriately named services module (no ideas off the top of my head yet) and keep GetNearestComponentForPath here.",
