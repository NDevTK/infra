      "message": "Hi Otabek, about the test_audiojack label, it is also configured from UFS/shivas right? or is there any other recommended way to change the label value?\n\nEarlier I was thinking of using shivas and put logic to set N/A there. Next, we can set it manually, and the configuration will propagate from UFS to both Skylab and TLW. (submit other CLs like crrev/c/4612950 and crrev/c/4622972)\n\nAre you suggesting we directly check the test_audiojack label here, and no need to touch shivas? (simply import Skylab here?) It will be greatly appreciated if you can provide an example for us üôè",
